# Hi there! My name is Oswaldo Coronel. Welcome to my GitHub profile
**Front-end developer**

I am a computer engineer specialized in web development, coming straight from Venezuela where I graduated in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am in Madrid, where I have had the opportunity to work on various projects in companies such as Oneclick, Binalogue, MVP Cluster, NATEEVO, and VASS, applying my skills in HTML5, PUG, CSS (including SASS and LESS), jQuery, JavaScript, Semantic UI, Bootstrap 3 and 4, Wordpress, Drupal, Gulp, Angular, VUE, and ReactJS.

In addition to my experience in web development and design, I have extensive knowledge in databases. My academic background and previous employment at Citibank Venezuela have provided me with the necessary expertise to handle queries and make informed decisions in different departments of the company.

I am always eager to learn new technologies, and currently, I am focusing on AngularJS and Vue to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

If you have any interesting projects, I am open to hearing about them and would be delighted to be invited to participate.
